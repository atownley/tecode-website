TE-Code .NET Edition
</title>
<body>
<p>
This page contains information specific to the .NET edition of the
TE-Code libraries.  Currently, the .NET edition requires the following
software to run:
<ul>
<li>A .NET runtime and compiler</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://go-mono.org">Mono</a>, version 1.0.4 or later</li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">Microsoft .NET SDK</a>,
version 1.1</li>
</ul>
<li><a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net">NAnt</a>, version 0.85.1786
(from 2004-11-21) or later</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I have tested the .NET edition with earlier versions of both Mono and 
NAnt, but I am currently using the above versions for all testing and
development work.  I have not yet tried any of the other .NET
runtimes, but if you do and it works, please let me know (atownley -
at users sourceforge net).
</p>

<p>
At the moment, there are not any articles available which are specific
to the .NET edition, however, between the examples, the <a
href="java.html">Java edition articles</a> and the <a
href="msdn/index.html">API documentation</a>, I think you should be
able to get started using it.  At some point in the very near future,
I hope to have some new articles available which are independent
of the Java edition.

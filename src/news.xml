ESB Stencil Expanded
</title>
<body>
<p>
Based on actually trying to use these things, I discovered
that my icons were a little large for more complicated
diagrams.  Therefore, I have now added smaller versions of
each of the base icons to the stencil.

ESB Stencil Added
</title>
<body>
<p>
After finishing the book <book
link="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/esb">Enterprise Service
Bus</book> by Dave Chappell of <a
href="http://www.sonicsoftware.com">Sonic Software</a>, I decided that
it would be in the interest of the community to create a set
of stencils based on the ones used in his book.  These have
been added to the <code>te-code/tools</code> module of CVS.
</p>
<p>
Below is an example from the book created using the stencil.

On The Road to 3.0
</title>
<body>
<p>
Having now implemented parts of the libraries for both Java
and .NET, I realized that there were some better ways to do
things than what was in the earlier 2.1.0-pre2 release.
Therefore, I am now focused on migrating some of the new ideas
into the Java and getting the unit tests in place.  Since a
lot of things have been added since the 2.0 release, it makes
sense to go ahead and rev the major version number.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure a few things will be deprecated, but both for my own
sanity and for anyone who might be using this code, I intend
to not break backwards compatibility any more than necessary
(if at all).

Experimental Validator Package Added
</title>
<body>
<p>
After not really messing with it for a year, I am once again
looking at the subject of validation, but in a more general
sense than the facilities provided by the <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/validator/">Jakarta
Commons Validator</a> or by <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts">Struts Framework</a>.
These two packages are related, but they are targeted towards
validation of web/HTML forms.  I'm looking at the problem a
bit more abstractly, and hope to define a general mechanism
which will apply in stand-alone GUI applications, batch
processing and in web applications.  Watch this space, but
I'll warn you now... <strong>the code is very much a work in
progress</strong>.

Versioning NAnt Task for .NET
</title>
<body>
<p>
After discovering some differences in functionality between <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Jakarta Ant</a> and what
is currently implemented in NAnt, I bit the bullet and
implemented a custom NAnt task to deal with versioning the
library (and other projects).
</p>
<p>
Similar functionality is now in place for the Java and .NET
versions of the library, but things are a lot cleaner with the
custom task.  I think I need to look into just doing this for
the Java one as well since the gymnastics done in the
<code>build.xml</code> are pretty complicated.  That's a job
for another day, though...

Hello, NAnt!
</title>
<body>
<p>
All I can say is that I'm soooo happy that the <a
href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/authors.html">NAnt Team</a>
exists!  I was really getting tired of messing around with
<code>make</code> again--especially with the version that
comes with the Microsoft tools.
</p>
<p>
The .NET version of the project now includes a
<code>te-common.xml</code> build file that is based on the one
for the Java version.  At least my life is a lot better
regarding doing builds.

Initial Import of te-common.NET
</title>
<body>
<p>
Today the initial port of te-common's command line argument handling
library was added to the CVS repository.  The source may be retrieved
by checking out the <code>te-code/te-common.NET</code> module.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the project provides build support for both <a
href="http://go-mono.org">Ximian's Mono project, version 0.31</a> as
well as using
<code>nmake</code> under Windows and the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">Microsoft .NET SDK, version
1.1</a>.  As an aside, I had forgotten what a pain it was to make
platform-independent makefiles...
